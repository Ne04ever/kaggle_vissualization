Scatter plots
 

 sns.scatterplot(x=insurance_data['bmi'], y=insurance_data['charges'])





To double-check the strength of this relationship, you might like to add a regression line, or the line that best fits the data. We do this by changing the command to sns.regplot.


sns.regplot(x=insurance_data['bmi'], y=insurance_data['charges'])







Color-coded scatter plots

We can use scatter plots to display the relationships between (not two, but...) three variables! One way of doing this is by color-coding the points.

For instance, to understand how smoking affects the relationship between BMI and insurance costs, we can color-code the points by 'smoker', and plot the other two columns ('bmi', 'charges') on the axes.

sns.scatterplot(x=insurance_data['bmi'], y=insurance_data['charges'], hue=insurance_data['smoker'])





 to add two regression lines, corresponding to smokers and nonsmokers.
 
sns.lmplot(x="bmi", y="charges", hue="smoker", data=insurance_data)





 categorical scatter plot, and we build it with the sns.swarmplot command.

sns.swarmplot(x=insurance_data['smoker'],
              y=insurance_data['charges'])
