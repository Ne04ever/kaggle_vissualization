Bar chart

Say we'd like to create a bar chart showing the average arrival delay for Spirit Airlines (airline code: NK) flights, by month.



# Set the width and height of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))

# Add title
plt.title("Average Arrival Delay for Spirit Airlines Flights, by Month")

# Bar chart showing average arrival delay for Spirit Airlines flights by month
sns.barplot(x=flight_data.index, y=flight_data['NK'])

# Add label for vertical axis
plt.ylabel("Arrival delay (in minutes)")




    Important Note: You must select the indexing column with flight_data.index, and it is not possible to use flight_data['Month'] (which will return an error).
    
    
    
    
    
    
Heatmap



In the code cell below, we create a heatmap to quickly visualize patterns in flight_data. Each cell is color-coded according to its corresponding value.

# Set the width and height of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(14,7))

# Add title
plt.title("Average Arrival Delay for Each Airline, by Month")

# Heatmap showing average arrival delay for each airline by month
sns.heatmap(data=flight_data, annot=True)

# Add label for horizontal axis
plt.xlabel("Airline")



    annot=True - This ensures that the values for each cell appear on the chart. (Leaving this out removes the numbers from each of the cells!)
